<h2>Local Variables</h2>
<p>
When writing a paper, you can have well-crafted, correctly spelled sentences and
create “A“ work. Or you can hack out the text in a hurry. It will not look as good,
but it can convey your thoughts and get the job done; it’s worth maybe a “B“ or a
“C“. Computer code is not like that. Code that is messy tends to have all sorts of
bugs and other problems. Messy code attracts problems like a half-eaten lollipop
attracts lint. The problems and bugs in poorly written code tend to compound each
other and pile up, so the code ends up nearly worthless. It has bugs. Nobody
knows how to fix them or add features without creating more bugs. Once code is in
that state, it is hard to escape. In a sense, code tends to be more either “A“, or “D“
or “F“. Therefore, it is best to write code that is clean to start, and keep it clean as
you add features. This is one of the lessons in CS for successfully building large
projects. For that reason CS 106A emphasizes the habits of clean, well-engineered
            code right from the start, building the right habits for the future.</p> 
<p>
One reason to write clean, well-structured code is that it works better and takes less
time in the end. The other reason to write clean code is that it is just more
satisfying to do a good job on something. Clear, elegant code feels right, just like
any other engineering or artistic creation. Doing it right the first time is better for
your engineering soul.
        </p>
        <h2>Local Variables Example</h2>
        <p>Consider, for example, the following snippet of code.</p>
<span class="gallery">
<img src="img-var/img-localVar.PNG" alt="link to code" class="imageTutorial" si> 
</span>
<p>
The variables <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are local variables declared within different methods in the
class <b>AnExample</b>. Because these variables are local variables, <i>a</i> can only be referred
to within <b>methodOne</b> and variable <i>b</i> can only be accessed within <b>methodTwo</b>. Our
attempt to initialize <i>b</i> using the value of <i>a</i> is illegal, as code in <b>methodTwo</b> cannot
access local variables from <b>methodOne</b> or any other method. Because local variable values do not persist after their containing method has
completed, the variable <i>a</i> will be destroyed when <b>methodOne</b> has completed
execution. The next time <b>methodOne</b> is called, <i>a</i> new variable a will be created.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<a class="anchor" name="blockScope"></a>
<h2>Block Scope</h2>
<p>While we typically think of local variables as local to a particular method, in Java
local variables are actually local to a <i>block</i> of code. While a method defines a block
of code (since the opening and closing braces of the method define a block), <i>for</i> and
<i>while</i> loops, <i>if</i> -statements, and other constructs are also considered blocks of code.
If we declare a local variable inside one of these constructs, the local variable will
be created when it is declared in the block and destroyed when the block ends
execution. Consider the following example:</p>
    
<span class="gallery">
<img src="img-var/img-block.PNG" alt="link to code" class="imageTutorial" si> 
</span>

<p>
The variable <i>a</i> is local to <b>methodThree</b>, so accessing a within the <b>for</b> loop, or in the <b>println</b> is fine. The variables <i>i</i> and <i>b</i> are only in scope (i.e., “alive“) within the
confines of the for loop in which they are declared. They are no longer available by
the time the last two printlns try to access them. The variable <i>c</i> is only in scope within the confines of the <b>if</b> statement body in which it is declared. Note that <i>a</i> new
copy of <i>c</i> will get created each time the <b>if</b> statement body is executed, therefore it
cannot be used to store values across iterations of the <b>for</b> loop.
</p>

<section>
<a class="anchor" name="instanceVar"></a>
<h2>Instance Variables</h2>
<p>Instance variables (also known as “ivars“) are defined as part of a class, but not
within any particular method of the class. Each object of the class will have its own
independent copy of all the instance variables defined in a class. Instance variables
are created when an object is created. They are destroyed when their corresponding
object is destroyed. Instance variables can be accessed from any method defined as
part of the class in which the instance variable is defined. Access to instance
variables from <i>other</i> classes is controlled by the variable’s visibility specifier (e.g.,
<b>public</b> or <b>private</b>). Instance variables that are <b>public</b> are accessible from methods in
other classes while those that are <b>private</b> (which is by far the more common case)
are not.
</p>
<h2>Instance Variables Examples</h2>
<span class="gallery">
<img src="img-var/img-inst1.PNG" alt="link to code" class="imageTutorial" si> 
</span>
    
<p>
In this case we have a class <b>Thing</b> which has an instance variable <i>x</i>. Each instance
of the class has its own independent copy of the variable. Our main program creates
three instances (objects) of the <b>Thing</b> class. It then sets the value of each instance’s
<i>x</i> variable. Because there are three different Thing objects, there are three different
<i>x</i> variables—one <i>x</i> variable per instance. We can change the variable values
independently from one another. When we print out the results we’ll see:
</p>
<span class="gallery">

</span>
</section>

<section>
<a class="anchor" name="classVar"></a>
<h2>Class Variables</h2>
    
<p>
As with instance variables, class variables are defined as part of a class. However, in
contrast to instance variables, with a class variable there is only one copy of the
variable which is shared by all instances of the class. Similar to an instance variable,
a class variable can be accessed by any method in the class in which the variable is
declared. Access to class variables from other classes is controlled by the variable’s
visibility specifier (e.g., <b>public</b> or <b>private</b>). Class variables that are <b>public</b> are
accessible from methods in other classes while those that are <b>private</b> are not.
</p>
    
<p>
Syntactically, class variable declarations are distinguished from instance variable
declarations by using the keyword <b>static</b> before the variable type in the variable
declaration. Because of this, class variables are sometimes referred to as <b>static</b>
variables. Note that the constants you have seen so far were all in fact class
variables, since they were defined using the keyword <b>static</b>, and it would make
sense that all objects of a particular class would share the same value for some
constant.
</p>
    
<h2>Class Variables Examples</h2>
<span class="gallery">
<img src="img-var/img-class1-1.PNG" alt="link to code" class="imageTutorial" si> 
</span>
    <span class="gallery">
<img src="img-var/img-class1-2.PNG" alt="link to code" class="imageTutorial" si> 
</span>


<p>
In this case we have a class <b>Thing</b> which has a public instance variable <i>x</i> and <i>a</i>
public class variable <i>y</i>. All instances (objects) of that class share the variable. Our
main program creates three instances of the <b>Thing</b> class. When it changes the value
of <i>y</i>, it is changing the value shared by all the instances. When we print the results,
we’ll see:
</p>
    
<span class="gallery">
<img src="img-var/img-class2.PNG" alt="link to code" class="imageTutorial" si> 
</span>

<p>
As seen in the example above, a public class variable can be accessed via the name
of the class instead of through an instance of the class like this:
</p>
    
<span class="gallery">
<img src="img-var/img-class3.PNG" alt="link to code" class="imageTutorial" si> 
</span>
    
<p>
This has an important advantage over accessing the variable via the name of an
instance of the object: it emphasizes that <i>y</i> is really a property of the class, shared
by all the instances of a class, rather than a property of a particular instance of the
class. Compare the following two code snippets:
</p>
<i>Example 1</i>
<span class="gallery">
<img src="img-var/img-class4.PNG" alt="link to code" class="imageTutorial" si> 
</span>
<i>Example 2</i>
<span class="gallery">
<img src="img-var/img-class5.PNG" alt="link to code" class="imageTutorial" si> 
</span>
    

<p>
Looking at <i>Example 1</i>, we cannot tell whether <i>y</i> is an instance variable or a class
variable. In order to know for sure which type of variable is in use, we need to
search out the declaration for the <i>y</i> variable and see if it used the <b>static</b> keyword. In
contrast, looking at <i>Example 2</i>, we see that <i>y</i> must be a class variable, because we
cannot access an instance variable using a class name. Because of this reason, using
the name of the class (rather than the name of an instance) is the preferred method
for accessing a class variable.
</p>

<section>
<a class="anchor" name="constants"></a>
<h2>Constants</h2>

<p>
As we discussed in class, we will sometimes find it useful to define a “variable“
whose value does not change during the entire program. Such a variable is called a
<b>constant</b>. In this case, the constant does not fulfill the traditional purpose of a
variable (i.e., storing a temporary program value). To declare a variable as a
constant, use the keyword <b>final</b> when declaring the variable. As mentioned above,
virtually all constants are <i>class</i> variables. However, it is possible to also define
constant instance variables or constant local variables.
