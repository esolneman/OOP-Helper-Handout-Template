            When writing a paper, you can have well-crafted, correctly spelled sentences and
create “A“ work. Or you can hack out the text in a hurry. It will not look as good,
but it can convey your thoughts and get the job done; it’s worth maybe a “B“ or a
“C“. Computer code is not like that. Code that is messy tends to have all sorts of
bugs and other problems. Messy code attracts problems like a half-eaten lollipop
attracts lint. The problems and bugs in poorly written code tend to compound each
other and pile up, so the code ends up nearly worthless. It has bugs. Nobody
knows how to fix them or add features without creating more bugs. Once code is in
that state, it is hard to escape. In a sense, code tends to be more either “A“, or “D“
or “F“. Therefore, it is best to write code that is clean to start, and keep it clean as
you add features. This is one of the lessons in CS for successfully building large
projects. For that reason CS 106A emphasizes the habits of clean, well-engineered
code right from the start, building the right habits for the future.
            </p>
            <p >
                One reason to write clean, well-structured code is that it works better and takes less
time in the end. The other reason to write clean code is that it is just more
satisfying to do a good job on something. Clear, elegant code feels right, just like
any other engineering or artistic creation. Doing it right the first time is better for
your engineering soul.

        <h2>The messy code trap</h2>
            <p>
        It is a basic fact of computer science that poorly designed, messy code is harder to
build and debug than clean code. It is tempting to just type out a quick solution as
it occurs to you to get started. It is better to take a little more time at the start to
build the clean version, creating fewer headaches in the debugging phase. Once
code gets messy, it’s hard to clean it up. It’s easier to start clean, and then keep it
clean with each addition. The worst possible strategy is to build the messy version,
do your debugging on that, and then clean it up before turning it in—all the work
and little of the benefit! Do it the right way from the start, and you’ll be happier.
            </p>

<a class="anchor" name="readable"></a>
<h2>Readable</h2>
<p>One metric for good code is that it “reads? nicely—that someone sweeping their
eye over the code can see the algorithmic idea at hand. The original programmer
had an idea in mind—a way to solve the problem. Does the code communicate that
idea? Writing readable code is important both because it will help any future
reader and because it helps you avoid your own bugs. Bugs, after all, are simply
where the code expresses an idea, but it is not the idea you had in mind. Readable
code has fewer bugs.</p>
</section>
        
<section>
<a class="anchor" name="varnames"></a>
<h2>Variable names</h2>
<p>The first step in readable code is choosing good names for variables. Typically a
variable gets a noun name that reflects what it stores—width or url or parent. If
you have the number 2, but do not know anything about it, then the generic num is
an okay name. If you know more specifically that it’s a weight or a number of
pixels then the name should reflect that knowledge. In Java, the convention is to
begin variables with the first word lowercase, and uppercase later words like this:
bestScore, remainingCreamPuffs. If you have a pointer to an object but without
any more specific word to use for its variable name, then you can use the name of
the class in lowercase. So if code deals with a Circle or Person object, then obvious
variable names are circle or person. If you know something more specific about the
objects, then more specific names like leftCircle or mother are better. There are a
few idiomatic one-letter names—i, j, k for int loop counters; x, y, z for coordinates.
These are in such wide use that they make very readable code just by familiarity.</p>
</section>
        
<section>
<a class="anchor" name="methodnames"></a>
<h2>Method names</h2>
<p>If variables names are the nouns, method names are the verbs. Method names
should reflect the action they perform—removeAll(), drawLine(), getX(). The
prefixes get and set have a typical role. A get method gets a piece of information
from an object, either a value that the object stores or computes: getWidth(),
getNumChildren(). Likewise, set methods typically are used to pass a value in to
an object for it to store or use: setWidth(int width). Methods that return a boolean
are often named starting with is or has.</p>
</section>
        
<section>
<a class="anchor" name="whitespaces"></a>
<h2>Whitespace</h2>
<p>Use whitespace to help separate the logical parts of the code, in much the same
way that paragraphs separate groups of sentences. Rather than write a block of 20
lines, it’s nice to put in blank lines to separate the code into its natural 6-line
sections that accomplish logical sub-parts of the computation. Each little section of
code might have a comment to describe what it accomplishes. Likewise, you can use whitespace to show the logical grouping of elements within a line. Do not run
everything together with no spaces. Here are a few examples</p>

</section>
        
<section>
<a class="anchor" name="indentation"></a>
<h2>Indentation</h2>
<p>All programming languages use indentation to show which parts of the code are
owned or controlled by other parts. In CS 106A, whenever there is a {, the code on
the next line should be indented—this applies to methods, classes, if-statements,
loops, and so on. Eclipse will do this automatically. Hit the tab key to indent one
level manually. You can also select a few lines and use tab to move them all right on
level, and shift-tab to move them all left one level. At the end of the indented code
the matching } should not be indented. In this way, the indented section is visually
set-off from the outer { } that controls it, as shown:</p>

</section>
        
<section>
<a class="anchor" name="comments"></a>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Comments add the human context to the raw lines of code. They explain the overall
flow and strategy of what is going on. Comments point out assumptions or issues
that affect a part of the program that are not obvious from the code itself.
As you write larger and more complex pieces of code, comments help you keep
track of your own assumptions and ideas, as you scroll around, building and
testing various parts of the code. There gets to be more than you can keep in your
head at one time. The first step is good variable and method names. They make the
code “read“ well on its own, so fewer comments are required.</p>
<h3>Class comments</h3>
<p>Each class should have a comment summarizing what it does. Typically the class
comment will mention what sort of data the class encapsulates and what sort of
methods it implements. Professional quality documentation for a class or group of
classes intended for use by others, such as the String class, will also have a few
introductory paragraphs of discussion of what sort of problems the class solves and
what typical client use of the class looks like. For a system of classes, there may be
an architectural overview that summarizes the role of each class and how they all
fit together to build the program.</p>
<h3>Variable comments</h3>
<p>Sometimes the meaning of an instance variable or local variable is completely clear
just from its name. For a complex variable, there is often extra contextual
information about the variable that the code must be consistent about. A comment
where the instance variable is declared is the perfect place to document such
side-issues for the variable: what are its units? Are there constraints on what values
it is allowed to take on? For example, weight might be the perfect name for an
instance variable indicating the weight of the object, but you still need to know, say
for a car simulator, that it is in pounds, or that the weight is for the car but does not
include the passengers or fuel. There is often ancillary information about an
instance variable—its meaning, assumptions, and constraints—beyond what is
captured in its name. The comment for an instance variable can capture this extra
information about the variable in one place.</p>
<h3>Method comments</h3>
<p>Method comments should describe what the method accomplishes. Emphasize
what the method does for the caller, not how it is implemented. The comment
should describe what the method does to the receiver object, adding in the role of
any parameters. In the standard comment style used with javadoc, the method comment begin with a verb in the third-person singular form (typically ending in
“s“) describing what the method does. For a complex method, the comment can
address the preconditions that should be true before the method is called, and the
postconditions that will be true after it is done.</p>
